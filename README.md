BButils
=============
 
These units consist of important low-level functions missing in FreePascal. For example:

*    Various array functions (add, delete, search, prealloc, ...)
*    Various string functions (pchar/ansistring, compare, split, search, convert html entities, ...)
*    Mathematical functions (gcd, primes, Bernoulli statistics,...)
*    Automatical translation of with tr['marked strings'] and components
